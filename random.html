			COVID-19 Data Analysis
		</div>
		<div id="detail1" align="left">Completed in 2020 for the Kaggle COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Competition. This Jupyter notebook contains an analysis of the large volume of text data (consisting primarily of research papers related to COVID-19 and other coronaviruses) provided by Kaggle. In it, I utilize Latent Dirichlet Allocation to identify papers pertaining to public health control measures, and combine the results with other datasets to perform two case studies.

			<em>The Tale of Munt</em>

		<div id="detail2">A story about an ambitious and rather arrogant young college student named Munt.

Still in progress.
