	    	<b>Learning</b> is the core of my being. An undergraduate nearing the end of my tenure at UC Berkeley, I spend my academic hours getting lost in mathematical theory and its applications to computer science - most notably studying data science and machine learning. My passions lie at the intersection of technical knowledge and social connection, and I have a particular penchant for teaching computer science.

	    	<b>Excitement</b> defined my childhood. My parents often say that I was always running, stopping only long enough to allow relatives to goad me toward them with candy, and being on my way again as soon as the sweet was mine. That same hyperactivity and ambition flow through my veins today, though perhaps tempered by the necessities of society. After all, as Dr. Seuss said, "Adults are just outdated children."

	    	<b>Ambition</b> is my guide as I carve out the path ahead. My ideal future consists of a computer science professorship, a position from which I can simultaneously engage myself in both the pursuit of knowledge and its dissemination. The ultimate goal is to one day solve computational theory's most pressing question: does P = NP? Combine that with a balanced diet and loving family, and my death will be a happy one.
