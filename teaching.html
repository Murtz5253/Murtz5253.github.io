		I focus on ensuring all of my students leave my class with a 
		solid foundation in programming and a genuine confidence 
		in their own abilities. Scroll down to see my teaching

		Teaching must be about the student, never about 
		the teacher. It is my genuine belief that the 
		oft-feared subjects of mathematics and 
		programming are accessible to everyone, if only 
		presented properly. A growth mindset is 
		essential, and can make the difference between a 
		student who succeeds and one who gives in. That 
		in mind, my philosophy is quite simple: take it 
		slowly, acknowledge the little victories, and never 
		give up on a student.
